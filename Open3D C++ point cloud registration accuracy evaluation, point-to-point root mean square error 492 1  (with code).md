###  1. Overview of the principle 

  The point cloud registration accuracy adopts the root mean square error RMSE. The smaller the root mean square error, the higher the registration accuracy. The root mean square error is defined as: 

 In the formula, it is the number of corresponding point pairs, the Euclidean distance between the corresponding points after registration, and the true value of the Euclidean distance between the corresponding points. In the absolute ideal state, the distance between the corresponding points after complete registration is 0, so the true value of the Euclidean distance between the corresponding points is 0.
