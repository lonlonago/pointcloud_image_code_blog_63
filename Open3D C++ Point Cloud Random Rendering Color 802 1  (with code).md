##  I. Overview 

  The range of colors in Open3D is [0.0, 1.0]. The function rand () in the C++ can be used to generate random numbers, and its return value is an integer. To generate floating-point numbers between 0.0 and 1.0, it must be converted. First generate a random number of 0-N, and then divide it by N + 1 converted to floating-point numbers to get the random number generator we want. Where N can adjust the range of precision we want, and when N = 99, keep two decimal places.
