##  I. Overview of algorithms 

  Given the number of sampling points, downsample to a fixed number of points. Among them, the code uses a large number of functions C++ 11 STL standard library. This code is not Open3D's own calling function, just for my practice of learning C++ standard library. 

##  Code implementation
