##  First, the principle of the algorithm 

###  1. Algorithm overview 

  The general equation of the three-dimensional space plane is: assume that the coordinates of the three-dimensional space that is not on the plane are, and the coordinates of the projection point on the plane are. Because the projection point to the current point is perpendicular to the plane, according to the vertical constraint condition, the following conditions are satisfied: Substituting (2) and (3) into (1) can be solved: substituting (4) into (2), (3), we can get: 

  Projection coordinates from three-dimensional point to plane are obtained.
