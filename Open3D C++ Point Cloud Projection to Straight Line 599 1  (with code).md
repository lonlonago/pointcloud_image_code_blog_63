##  First, the principle of the algorithm 

  There are three representations of straight line equations: general formula, point-to-point formula, and parametric formula. PCL uniformly adopts the point-to-point formula. The point-to-point equation of a straight line is: Among them, the direction vector, the known point. The coordinates of the projection point from a point outside the line to the line are: In formula (2), it is:
